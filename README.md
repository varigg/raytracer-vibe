# Raytracer Vibe

This project is a raytracer built in Go.

## ðŸ¤– AI-Driven Development

This entire project is being written by Google's Gemini large language model. The goal is to build a fully functional raytracer from the ground up, guided by high-level objectives.

## Current Status

The foundational `tuples` package is complete, providing support for vector and point operations, which are the building blocks for the raytracer.

## Running Tests

To run the existing tests, use the following command:

```bash
go test ./...
```
